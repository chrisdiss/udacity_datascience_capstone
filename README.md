# udacity_datascience_capstone

## Objective & overview
Goal of the project is to analyze data from Starbucks about their consumer behaviour regarding to certain offer strategies. It should be analyzed which offer strategies apply to which group of customers best, if there is a significant difference between groups. With this in mind Starbucks could gain insights about the way how to best promote and offer coupons and increase the efficacy of such offers.

First, it is necessary to get familiar with the data and to perform some data wrangling and cleaning. After this some descriptive and some more advanced statistical analyses will be done to find possible insights in the data. The insights will be supported with useful visualizations.

## Data
The data was provided by Starbucks during the Udacity Nanodegree Data Science.

## Conclusion

To see the bigger picture it was necessary to deep dive into the data and into single steps. For me starting point of the analysis was to see if the user journey from receiving an offer to viewing and completing it has some special characteristics to inform further offer strategies.

Looking at a user level it can be seen that women tend to be a more lucrative source for Starbucks as they tend to have a higher completion rate of the offers and also have a higher average transaction value. Also income seems to increase for the users that complete an offer. Interestingly men have a slightly higher increase which could make men with a higher income a potential target for new offers.

In general it can be said that the web channel has the best performance in completion rate follwed by social. Also interestingly there can be no differences be detected in user characteristics which leads me to the implication that the web channel just has a better performance.

In the end looking at the offer types discount have a better performance than bogo which could Starbucks lead to the implication that for further strategies discounts are the most effective way when it comes down to offer completion ratio.

To sum up, to increase the offer effectiveness Starbucks could focus on female users using the web channel and offering more discounts.
